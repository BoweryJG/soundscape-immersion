DEEP SPACE AMBIENT SOUNDSCAPE
==============================

URL: https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/multimedia/sonifications/
Data Source: Hubble Space Telescope observations
Format: MP3/WAV
Processing: Data sonification of astronomical observations

Description:
Deep space ambient sounds created from real Hubble Space Telescope data converted into audio frequencies. These sonifications transform light data from distant galaxies, nebulae, and cosmic phenomena into hauntingly beautiful ambient soundscapes.

Technical Process:
- Hubble observes electromagnetic radiation across spectrum
- Data mapped to audible frequencies (20Hz-20kHz)
- Different wavelengths assigned to different tones
- Radio waves → lowest tones
- Visible light → medium tones  
- X-rays → highest tones

Featured Sonifications:
- Galaxy cluster collisions
- Supernova remnants
- Planetary nebulae
- Black hole accretion disks
- Deep field observations

NASA Sonification Projects:
1. "Listen to the Universe" documentary series
2. Hubble data sonification app
3. Chandra X-ray Observatory sounds
4. James Webb Space Telescope sonifications
