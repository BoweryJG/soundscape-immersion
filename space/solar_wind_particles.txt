Data Source: 40 days of SOHO spacecraft observations
Processing: Sped up 42,000x to reach audible frequencies
Format: MP3/WAV

Description:
The actual "sound" of our Sun created from solar wind particle data collected by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Solar wind consists of charged particles (protons, electrons, alpha particles) streaming from the Sun's corona at speeds of 300-800 km/s.

Solar Wind Components:
- Protons (90%)
- Electrons (9%)
- Alpha particles (helium nuclei)
- Heavier ions (trace amounts)
- Magnetic field fluctuations

Data Collection Process:
1. SOHO monitors solar wind density and velocity
2. Magnetic field measurements detect turbulence
3. Particle interactions create electromagnetic waves
4. Data converted to audio frequencies
5. Time-compressed to human hearing range

Featured NASA Recordings:
- Solar wind turbulence (rumbling magnetometer data)
- Coronal mass ejection impacts
- Solar storm electromagnetic signatures
- Heliospheric current sheet crossings
- Termination shock boundary sounds

Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE):
- 1998-2010 charged atom recordings
- Carbon ions in solar wind
- Real-time solar wind monitoring
- Space weather prediction data

Heliophysics Audio Projects:
- NASA satellites as "audio recorders"
- Solar electromagnetic symphony
- Parker Solar Probe close-up recordings
- Multi-spacecraft solar wind ensemble

Applications:
- Solar meditation and sun worship
- Space weather education
- Cosmic connection practices
- Astronomical documentary soundtracks
- Ambient space music composition

Technical Details:
- Original frequencies too low for human hearing
- 42,000x speed increase brings into audible range
- Represents real solar activity patterns
- Varies with solar cycle and storm activity
