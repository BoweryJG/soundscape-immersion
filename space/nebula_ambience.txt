Format: MP3/WAV

Description:
Ethereal ambient soundscapes created from real nebula data using multi-wavelength astronomy observations. These sonifications transform the invisible electromagnetic emissions from stellar nurseries, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants into haunting cosmic music.

Types of Nebulae Sonified:
1. **Emission Nebulae** - Hot gas glowing from stellar radiation
2. **Planetary Nebulae** - Dying star shells (not related to planets)
3. **Supernova Remnants** - Stellar explosion aftermath
4. **Dark Nebulae** - Dense dust clouds blocking background light
5. **Reflection Nebulae** - Dust reflecting nearby starlight

Data Translation Methods:
- X-ray emissions → High frequency tones
- Optical light → Mid-range frequencies  
- Radio waves → Low frequency drones
- Infrared heat → Warm harmonic textures
- Stellar motion → Pitch modulation

Featured Nebula Sonifications:
- **Orion Nebula** - Stellar formation region
- **Crab Nebula** - Supernova remnant with pulsar
- **Ring Nebula** - Classic planetary nebula
- **Eagle Nebula** - "Pillars of Creation"
- **Rosette Nebula** - Emission nebula complex

NASA Sonification Techniques:
1. Frequency mapping of electromagnetic spectrum
2. Brightness converted to volume/amplitude
3. Color information mapped to instrument timbres
4. Spatial data creates stereo positioning
5. Time-lapse observations show evolution

Multi-Telescope Collaborations:
- Hubble Space Telescope (optical)
- Chandra X-ray Observatory (X-rays)
- Spitzer Space Telescope (infrared)
- James Webb Space Telescope (near-infrared)
- Very Large Array (radio)
