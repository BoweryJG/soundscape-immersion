Description:
The actual sounds of interstellar space recorded by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft as they crossed from our solar system into the interstellar medium. These are the most distant human-made recordings, capturing the "voice" of the space between stars.

Historic Achievements:
- **Voyager 1**: First human-made object in interstellar space (August 2012)
- **Voyager 2**: Second spacecraft to cross heliopause (November 2018)
- **Distance**: Over 14+ billion miles from Earth
- **Data**: 40+ years of continuous plasma wave monitoring

Sonic Characteristics:
- **Heliosphere**: Low frequencies ~300 Hz (solar wind plasma)
- **Interstellar**: Higher frequencies 2-3 kHz (denser cosmic plasma)
- **Termination Shock**: Dramatic frequency shifts at boundary
- **Heliopause**: Distinct change in electromagnetic signature

Key Recordings:
1. **Termination Shock Crossing** - Solar wind hits interstellar medium
2. **Electron Plasma Oscillations** - Charged particle interactions
3. **Interstellar Plasma Music** - Two major "outbursts" detected
   - October-November 2012
   - April-May 2013
4. **Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation** - Particle density changes

Scientific Context:
- Plasma waves are natural electromagnetic oscillations
- Human hearing range (20Hz-20kHz) captures these phenomena
- No traditional "sound" in space vacuum
- Antennas detect electric/magnetic field oscillations
- Direct scientific data, not synthesized

University of Iowa Archives:
- Complete Voyager plasma wave library
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune encounters
- Interplanetary cruise phase recordings
- Real-time data processing techniques
- Educational and research applications

Emotional Descriptions:
- "Hauntingly like human voices singing"
- "Giant Tibetan bowls resonating"
- "Cosmic wind through infinite space"
- "The loneliness of deep space"
- "Ancient electromagnetic conversations"

Technical Specifications:
- **Instruments**: PWS (Plasma Wave Subsystem)
- **Frequency Range**: 10 Hz to 56 kHz
- **Antenna Configuration**: 10-meter electric dipole
- **Data Rate**: Variable, optimized for distance
- **Processing**: Real-time and ground-based analysis

Applications:
- **Meditation**: Connection with cosmic scale
- **Education**: Understanding interstellar medium
- **Art**: Ambient music and sound installation
- **Research**: Plasma physics and space science
- **Philosophy**: Human presence in cosmic context

Cultural Impact:
- First sounds from outside our solar system
- Represents human reach into galactic space
- Audio documentation of historic space exploration
- Connection between Earth and interstellar medium
- Symbol of human curiosity and scientific achievement

Legacy Data:
- Continuous recording since 1977
- Expected to transmit until ~2025-2030
- Irreplaceable scientific and cultural resource
- Most distant human communication ever achieved
- Bridge between solar system and galaxy
