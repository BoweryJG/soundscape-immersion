Description:
Real cosmic radiation and charged particle interactions converted to audible sound. These recordings capture the electromagnetic "voice" of cosmic rays, solar particles, and interplanetary plasma as detected by spacecraft instruments.

Scientific Background:
- Cosmic rays are high-energy particles from deep space
- Plasma waves occur naturally at audible frequencies
- Spacecraft antennas detect oscillating electric/magnetic fields
- No sound travels in space, but plasma waves are electromagnetic

Data Sources:
1. Van Allen Probes - Earth's radiation belts
2. Parker Solar Probe - Solar wind and corona
3. Voyager 1 & 2 - Interstellar plasma
4. Cassini - Saturn's magnetosphere
5. Juno - Jupiter's radiation environment

CRaTER Live Project:
- Real-time cosmic ray detection on Moon
- Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data
- Musical instruments reflect radiation intensity
- Streaming audio based on particle impacts

Featured Recordings:
- Solar flare electromagnetic bursts
- Cosmic ray shower events
- Magnetosphere boundary crossings
- Planetary radiation belt sounds
- Interstellar medium interactions

Applications:
- Scientific education and outreach
- Ambient space meditation
- Cosmic awareness and connection
- Background for space documentaries
- Artistic and creative projects

Technical Notes:
- Frequencies in human hearing range (20Hz-20kHz)
- Real electromagnetic data, not synthesized
- Multiple spacecraft provide different perspectives
- Creative Commons licensing allows broad use
